## What this is

Most LLM forecasting systems ask a model for a probability. Cascade asks a
different question: **what would have to happen for this outcome to occur, who
would have to do it, and what do they each know?**

A question like *"will the regulator clear this merger before the deadline?"*
is compiled into a typed **causal graph** — 8–20 actors with objectives and
levers, 4–12 world factors with their own dynamics, and a monotone outcome
rule. That graph is then simulated for 24 steps: actors observe a *partial,
noisy, lagged* view of the world determined by their position in the graph,
choose actions, and a deterministic arbiter folds those actions into the next
world state. Run it 200 times from 200 seeds and the spread of terminal
outcomes is a forecast **and** a statement about how settled the question is.

Three properties are load-bearing, and each is enforced by a mechanism rather
than by discipline:

| | |
|---|---|
| **No hindsight** | Retrieval is time-locked at the database level. A query at cutoff *T* cannot return a document published at *T*. The simulation role has no `SELECT` grant on the outcomes table at all. |
| **Bit-exact replay** | One RNG per run, seeded once, drawn in a documented order. Every model call is content-addressed and replayed from disk. 25 stored runs re-run in fresh interpreters reproduce their event-log hash byte for byte. |
| **Full provenance** | Every agent decision is an append-only row carrying what it was responding to. `cascade trace explain` walks an outcome back to the exogenous shock that started it, in under a second. |

---

## Status: what is measured, and what is not

> **This section is the point of the README.** The project's first rule is that
> the report prints measured values and that no target is ever written into a
> report code path — enforced by a static check over every module on that path.
> The same rule applies here. Everything below is a number this repository
> produced; the headline study results **do not exist yet** and are not quoted.

**Nine milestones, M0–M8 complete, M9 (presentation) in progress.**

### Measured

| Quantity | Measured | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Backtest scenarios | **180**, YES rate **0.5000**, no domain above **25.0%** | M1 |
| Frozen split | sealed at `30d9c61d…`, re-hashed and asserted before any label is read | M1 |
| Climatology floor | Brier **0.250000** over the sealed set | M1 |
| Evidence corpus | **1,950,912** chunks across **492,270** documents, 0 NULL/future dates, 100% embedding coverage | M2 |
| Evidence coverage | every scenario covered at its own cutoff; median **67,590** admissible chunks in an 18-month window, median staleness **1 day** | M2 |
| Retrieval recall@20 | **0.9675** vs exhaustive search (criterion > 0.92) | M3 / M8 |
| Retrieval p95 | **90.92 ms** over 10,000 queries (criterion < 15 ms — **not met**, see [Limitations](#limitations)) | M3 / M8 |
| Poison-pill leakage | **0 of 500** planted post-cutoff documents retrieved, across all 180 cutoffs | M3 |
| Arbiter properties | bounded, conserving, permutation-invariant, monotone — all pass under Hypothesis | M5 |
| Replay determinism | **25/25** runs byte-identical across processes, 24.3 s | M8 |
| Provenance chain | complete to a root cause in **0.27 s** | M8 |
| Test suite | **1,331 passing**, 1 skipped; ruff, black and mypy strict clean over 98 modules | all |

### Not measured, and why

Five milestones' acceptance numbers need **540 Sonnet calls to compile 180
causal graphs**, and `CASCADE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is unset in the environment
this was built in. Everything downstream of those graphs is built, wired and
tested against a stand-in decider; nothing downstream of the *credential* can
be measured.

- **No compiled graphs** → no agent-driven runs, so no Brier, no skill scores,
  no ablation deltas, no calibration curve.
- **The cost ledger cannot be reconciled** against Langfuse, because no stored
  run has spent anything. `cascade trace cost` **exits non-zero** rather than
  reporting that zero agrees with zero.
- Runs made with the stand-in decider are stamped `policy='heuristic'` in the
  database, and any report built from them says so **above** its own headline.

That last point is deliberate. A footnote is not a mechanism; the column is.

Eight subsystems, each with one job:

| Subsystem | Package | Does |
|---|---|---|
| **Ledger** | `cascade/ledger/` | Builds and seals the 180-scenario registry with its base-rate and domain controls |
| **Chronofence** | `cascade/retrieval/` | Time-locked vector search — `as_of` has no default anywhere, in Python or SQL |
| **Lathe** | `cascade/decompose/` | Compiles a question into a validated `CausalGraph` (6 structural + semantic rules) |
| **Aperture** | `cascade/aperture/` | Derives who can see what from the graph's topology, with noise and lag per hop |
| **Loom** | `cascade/sim/` | The 24-step kernel and the deterministic arbiter — ~400 lines, no I/O, no LLM |
| **Chorus** | `cascade/ensemble/` | Fans out 36,000 runs in lockstep waves and collapses replicates into forecasts |
| **Assay** | `cascade/eval/` | Scoring, the 12-cell ablation grid, paired bootstrap, and the report artifact |
| **Strata** | `cascade/trace/` | Append-only event log, replay verification, provenance chains, cost ledger |

---

## Quickstart

**Prerequisites:** Docker, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Python 3.12.
No Anthropic key is needed for anything on this page.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/utkarsh430/cascade.git
cd cascade

make install          # uv sync --extra dev --extra kernel
make env              # writes .env from .env.example
make up               # Postgres 16 + pgvector 0.8, and Langfuse — waits for healthy
make migrate          # 16 forward-only SQL migrations
cascade doctor        # asserts the pinned stack and service health; exits 0 or tells you why
```

`cascade doctor` is the gate. It prints every pinned dependency with the
version actually installed, checks both services, and refuses to exit 0 if
anything has drifted.

> **Building the corpus or benchmarking retrieval?** Those paths need the
> embedding stack: `make install-full` adds torch and sentence-transformers
> (~2 GB). Nothing else on this page does — the model is imported lazily
> everywhere, and `cascade doctor` reports it as absent rather than failing.

---

## The 90-second demo

From a clean clone to a rendered causal trace. This runs entirely on the
deterministic stand-in decider — **no API key, no spend**. `make demo` runs all
five steps; they are spelled out here so you can see what each one proves.

```bash
# 1. Build and seal the 180-scenario registry  (~2 min, network)
cascade ledger build && cascade ledger seal

# 2. Run four ablation cells that need no compiled graph (~3 min)
#    C09-C12 are the "generic persona panel" arm, so they run without the compiler.
cascade eval grid --policy heuristic --cell C09 --cell C10 --cell C11 --cell C12 --limit 40

# 3. Prove the runs replay byte-identically in fresh processes
cascade trace replay --runs 25

# 4. Walk one outcome back to the exogenous shock that caused it
cascade trace explain          # --run is optional; defaults to the first stored run

# 5. Write the full report artifact
cascade report --headline C09
```

Step 4 prints:

```
outcome_score 0.53  <- factor 'momentum' moved last at step 23
  d0  step 23  actor=panelist_forecaster      COMMIT    +0.0007 on momentum
  d1  step 19  actor=panelist_advocate        COMMIT    +0.0007 on momentum
  ...
  d11 step  0  actor=panelist_forecaster      COMMIT    +0.0061 on momentum
  root  step  0  exogenous shock on 'resistance' +0.04
complete chain: 12 decision(s) to an exogenous shock at step 0
```

Step 5 writes `reports/study_<ts>/` with ten machine-readable files and four
SVG figures. Where a quantity could not be produced it is `null` in the JSON
and named in a **"Not produced"** section at the top of `headline.md` — never
filled in with the value the specification expects.

## Running the full study

Each phase is a subcommand, each is resumable, and each has a budget ceiling
that aborts rather than warns. Phases 3 onward need `CASCADE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

<details>
<summary><b>Phase-by-phase commands</b></summary>

### 1. Scenario registry (M1)
```bash
cascade ledger build       # 180 scenarios: base rate in [0.40, 0.60], no domain > 25%
cascade ledger seal        # writes manifest.sha256 — every later phase asserts it
cascade ledger verify
```

### 2. Evidence corpus (M2)
```bash
cascade corpus build       # resumable per unit; re-run until the target is met
cascade corpus verify      # exits 3 while short of 1.3M chunks
cascade corpus coverage    # evidence at each scenario's own cutoff; exits 3 when short
```

### 3. Time-locked retrieval (M3)
```bash
cascade retrieval index --drop-legacy   # one HNSW index per non-empty partition
cascade retrieval verify                # structural preconditions; exits 3 on drift
cascade retrieval bench                 # p50/p95/p99 + recall@20; exits 3 on a miss
make test-leakage                       # the poison-pill and date-monotonicity probes
```

### 4. Compile the causal graphs (M4) — *needs a key*
```bash
cascade compile build      # draft → critique → repair → validate, per scenario
cascade compile status     # graph statistics and the repair-retry histogram
cascade compile audit      # writes the seeded 20-graph human audit worksheet
```

### 5. Simulate (M5/M6) — *needs a key*
```bash
cascade simulate estimate --units 20    # dry run; exits 2 on a projected budget breach
cascade simulate all --wave 200         # the fan-out, batching each step across the wave
cascade ensemble collapse               # replicates → forecasts, label-blind
cascade ensemble convergence            # the replicate-count curve
```

### 6. Evaluate (M7) — *needs a key for 4 of 5 baselines*
```bash
cascade eval baselines --baseline climatology   # the one that needs no model
cascade eval estimate                            # baseline-phase dry run
cascade eval grid                                # all 12 Appendix C cells
cascade eval score --config-id C01
cascade eval significance
cascade report
```

### 7. Determinism and provenance (M8)
```bash
cascade trace status
cascade trace replay --runs 25          # byte-identical hashes across processes
cascade trace explain --run <run-id>    # provenance chain to a root cause
cascade trace cost                      # reconcile the ledger against Langfuse
```

</details>

### Cost

The study is priced at **$290 fully loaded** — $0.0035 marginal per run, and
$0.008 per run amortised over everything including the corpus, the compiler and
the whole ablation grid. Four levers make that possible: prompt caching, a
trajectory-prefix action cache, the Batch API, and a **deterministic arbiter**
that removes 864,000 model calls on its own.

Every phase has a hard ceiling in `configs/base.yaml`. A breach writes a
resumable checkpoint and exits `2`. Nothing warns.

## Engineering contract

`CLAUDE.md` is the contract this repository is built against: the invariants,
the pinned stack, and a build log with one entry per milestone recording what
shipped, what the acceptance numbers **actually were**, and what was deferred.

### The nine invariants

Each is enforced by a test, not by intention.

1. **`as_of` is never defaulted** — not in Python, not in SQL, not in a test helper.
2. **The simulation never reads `scenario_labels`** — enforced by a Postgres grant, not by code review.
3. **The arbiter contains no LLM call and no I/O** — asserted statically over its imports.
4. **One RNG per run**, seeded once, drawn in a fixed documented order.
5. **One LLM call site** — a grep for the SDK import anywhere else fails CI.
6. **The event log is append-only** — no `UPDATE`, no `DELETE`, ever.
7. **All iteration over collections is sorted** — dict order is a nondeterminism vector.
8. **Every phase is resumable** — checkpoint and skip completed units on restart.
9. **No target value is ever written into a report code path** — a static check parses every module on that path and fails on any literal from the measurement contract.

### Quality gates

```bash
make ci          # ruff + black + mypy strict + the offline test suite
make test        # offline only — no services needed
make test-all    # adds integration and leakage (needs `make up`)
```

| Gate | Status |
|---|---|
| ruff | clean |
| black | clean |
| mypy strict | clean, 98 modules |
| pytest | 1,331 passing, 1 skipped |

The suite is 72 files and about 17,000 lines across five categories: unit,
Hypothesis property tests, integration against live Postgres, **leakage**
probes that plant post-cutoff documents and assert none is ever retrieved, and
**determinism** tests that re-run a scenario in subprocesses under different
hash seeds.

---

## Limitations

Stated plainly, because a result that hides these is not a result.

1. **The headline study numbers do not exist.** No causal graph has been
   compiled by a model. Every figure in [Status](#status-what-is-measured-and-what-is-not)
   comes from the infrastructure or from runs made with a deterministic
   stand-in, which the database stamps as such.
2. **Retrieval p95 misses its budget — 90.92 ms against 15 ms.** The budget was
   derived for per-step retrieval (4.2M searches); a later decision moved
   retrieval to once per *(scenario, actor)*, roughly 2,520 searches, so the
   study's entire retrieval cost is about four minutes. The criterion is still
   missed and `cascade retrieval bench` still exits 3. The remaining gap is the
   partition count, measured at **3.9 ms fixed + 0.34 ms per partition**.
3. **Metaculus is unavailable** without a token, so the registry is sourced
   from Polymarket, Manifold and a curated file — a documented deviation from
   the specification's "~90 from Metaculus".
4. **The 16 curated scenarios are not independently verified.** They are
   authored from the public record and must be checked before publication: a
   curated label nobody can check is indistinguishable from an invented one.
5. **Parametric memorization is unmeasured.** The probe is implemented and
   CLI-wired but needs a key. A model that already knows how a 2018 merger
   resolved is a floor no amount of time-locking removes, and the number
   belongs beside the headline Brier rather than in a footnote.
6. **GDELT contributed nothing.** Its API serves a rolling recent window rather
   than the archive, and this network is rate-limited beyond practical use.

## Design decisions

27 architecture decision records live in [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) — see the
[index](docs/adr/README.md). Fifteen correct defects in the specification;
three correct defects found in this build. A few that shaped the system:

| ADR | Decision |
|---|---|
| [0002](docs/adr/0002-chronofence-security-definer.md) | `chronofence_search` needs `SECURITY DEFINER`; as specified the app role gets a permission error on its own function |
| [0005](docs/adr/0005-role-grants-deny-by-default.md) | Role grants deny by default — the spec's `REVOKE … FROM cascade_sim` is a no-op |
| [0015](docs/adr/0015-run-rng-draw-plan.md) | The whole step's randomness is drawn at once, so an ablation runs the identical stream through a different policy |
| [0019](docs/adr/0019-evidence-in-the-cached-prefix.md) | Evidence is retrieved once per (scenario, actor), not per step — 4.2M searches become 2,520 |
| [0023](docs/adr/0023-corpus-unit-granularity-and-demand-ordering.md) | Ingest order is a correctness concern: chronological units left a 1.76M-chunk corpus covering the wrong decade |
| [0025](docs/adr/0025-ablation-factors-a-and-c.md) | Two of four ablation factors were configuration fields nothing read — six of twelve cells would have been duplicates |
| [0026](docs/adr/0026-hnsw-and-bounded-candidate-pool.md) | HNSW replaces IVFFlat, and a parameterised `LIMIT` in a non-inlinable function cost 4× |

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). The short version: one milestone per
change, acceptance criteria written as failing tests first, and if a criterion
cannot be met — **stop and report the measured value with a diagnosis**. Do not
relax the criterion, do not add a tolerance, do not mark it approximately
passing.
