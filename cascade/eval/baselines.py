"""The five baselines (spec §10.2), and the market. Prompt construction is pure.

"Five, and all five appear in the report. Omitting the fair-compute baseline is
the most common way a multi-agent result gets dismissed."

Two of the five are configurations of the system itself -- the multi-agent
panel without decomposition is ablation cell C09 and the full system is C01 --
so they are scored from the forecasts those cells already produce rather than
re-run under another name. Running them twice would put two differently-seeded
copies of the same experiment in the report and invite the reader to wonder
which one is quoted.

The three that are not cells are built here:

* **Climatology** predicts the sealed set's own base rate for every scenario.
  Pure, no model, no evidence. It is the floor: beating it is necessary and
  not impressive.
* **Single model, direct** is one call per scenario with the *same* Chronofence
  evidence an agent gets. Same time lock, same k, same cutoff. Anything less
  and the comparison measures retrieval rather than architecture.
* **Single model, self-consistency** is the same prompt drawn 200 times and
  averaged. §10.2 calls it critical, and it is: it matches Cascade's sample
  budget, so a gain over it cannot be dismissed as "you just sampled more".

A sixth stands outside the spec's five (M14): **the market at the cutoff**,
the YES probability each scenario's own prediction market quoted strictly
before ``cutoff_ts``. §10.2's five are all models or arithmetic; this is the
one benchmark that is other people's money, and it is the comparison a
forecasting reader asks for first. It is built in ``cascade/eval/market.py``,
covers only the scenarios whose market had a usable price, and -- unlike every
other row here -- is scored from its own table rather than from ``forecasts``,
because ``cascade_sim`` can read ``forecasts`` and must not read a market price.

The self-consistency draws are distinguished by ``LLMRequest.sample_index``.
The call cache is content-addressed, so without it 200 identical requests would
be one recording replayed 200 times -- an ensemble with sigma exactly zero,
which would make the fair-compute baseline look structurally incapable of
dispersion for a reason that is an artefact of the cache rather than a fact
about single models.
