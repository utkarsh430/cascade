"""Assay's inference (spec §10.4). Pure: no I/O, no clock, no global RNG.

180 scenarios is a small sample and the differences under test are small --
the headline ablation effect is 0.035 Brier. Three things follow, and §10.4
requires all three:

**Pairing.** Every configuration scores the same scenarios, so the variance of
a *difference* is far smaller than the variance of either Brier. Resampling
scenarios and recomputing the difference inside each resample keeps that
pairing; resampling the two sets independently would throw it away and widen
every interval for no reason.

**Multiple-comparison control.** Twelve cells and five baselines is a family of
tests. Holm-Bonferroni is applied across it and the adjusted p-values are what
the report quotes.

**A seeded bootstrap.** The resampling RNG is derived from the study salt and
the pair being compared, so a confidence interval is reproducible from the
salt alone. An unseeded bootstrap puts a slightly different interval in the
report on every run, which is the same class of defect as an unseeded
simulation and considerably harder to notice.
