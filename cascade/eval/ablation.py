"""The 12-cell ablation grid (spec §10.3, Appendix C). Pure definitions.

Twelve cells, not sixteen. Four binary factors would give sixteen, but the
visibility policy is *derived* from the compiled causal graph, so information
asymmetry cannot be enabled when decomposition is disabled -- B nests in A and
the ``(A=off, B=on)`` quadrant is undefined rather than merely untested.

The grid is defined here rather than read from the overlay files, and then
**checked against them**. Two independent statements of the same design that
must agree is a test; one statement read twice is a transcription.

Reading the deltas correctly is the other thing this module is for. Because B
nests in A the leave-one-out deltas do not sum, and §10.3 requires the report
to say so. :func:`headline_comparisons` names the comparisons explicitly,
including the ``+0.008`` net figure §10.3 asks to be published *first* -- "the
number a careful reader will compute anyway".

    **This is CLAUDE.md's open question Q1, resolved explicitly rather than
    silently.** Appendix C gives the D factor as ``n in {200, 1}`` per cell,
    while §10.3 and §12.3 describe the 11 non-headline cells as "90 scenarios x
    30 replicates". Both cannot be literally true of a D=200 ablation cell.

    ``policy="budget_capped"`` reads D as the *design* factor and 30 as a
    *budget cap* applied to the non-headline cells -- so a D=200 ablation cell
    executes at 30. ``policy="design"`` runs every cell at its D factor, which
    is what Appendix C says and what §12.3's 29,700-run line does not fund.

    The returned sentence is carried into the report verbatim. §10.3's warning
    is that the ensemble contribution estimate depends on which reading is
    applied, so the report states which one it used rather than leaving a
    reader to infer it from a run count.

    The sentence is written in the present tense because it describes what the
    policy **prescribes**, not what happened: it is generated for all twelve
    cells including ones that were never executed, and "ran at 30" would be a
    claim about a cell with no runs. What a cell actually executed is
